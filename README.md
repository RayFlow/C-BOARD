# C-BOARD
Open Source version of the WBS designed forum/ discussion board for project collaboration in virtual teams - deployment of this single C-BOARD is easy, it will work on most free web hosting services, good for students to learn project collaboration and the benfits of a work breakdown structure. 

The .zip file available for download contains all files needed for your own deployment of the C-BOARD.
The .txt file "steps made for deployment" is a short & easy step-by-step documentation.

Be aware, that the C-BOARD is open source - but it is not "free software".
According to the license found in the package/.zip, you can download and use and modify the C-BOARD in the way you want - but you are not allowed to  make distributions of the application AND you are supposed to send us the modifications so WE can decide if we make these changes available to others as well.

More information about the functions & features can be found here:
http://c-board.de/OpenCBOARD.html

There you can find a short video how to map the Work Breakdown Structure of your existing project into the C-BOARD application simply by creating the hierachical forums one-by-one. (the tasks within the WBS-Elements are represented by the discussion-threads. If a tasks turns out to become bigger than expected, you can simply add an other WBS-element and move the task-related thread in there...)

There is now a complete groupware with an integrated C-BOARD available as well: the CYBR CSCW-SUITE CCS!
available for download:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/c-c-s/

For the CCS all code is based on TSL/SSL, the stanford javascrypt crypto library (sjcl), GnuPGP ... no exteranl sources, OpenVPN ready.
The CCS has a webbased SCRUM, a sharepoint like content management system, a virtual Shopfloormanagement application, CFLX-enhanced, PGP encrypted & WBS-assigned emails, multiprojectcapabilities... and regularily updates.
If you need a professional, secure solution: use the CCS!
