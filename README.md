# C-BOARD
Open Source version of the WBS designed forum/ discussion board for project collaboration in virtual teams

The .zip file available for download contains all files needed for your own deployment of the C-BOARD.
The .txt file "steps made for deployment" is a short & easy step-by-step documentation.

Be aware, that the C-BOARD is open source - but it is not "free software".
According to the license found in the package/.zip, you can download and use and modify the C-BOARD in the way you want - but you are not allowed to  make distributions of the application AND you are supposed to send us the modifications so WE can decide if we make these changes available to others as well.
